# World Wide Weeb - AnimeDB (in progress) ꩜
Allows you to search and display all the details about your favorite anime, including trailers, characters, and status. It also shows what is trending, the top airing anime, and the most goated anime. Once you have found an anime you like, you can add it to your watch list!

## Purpose
Aside from learning Next13, I built this project to share my ❤️ for animes.
